description: QualitySettings property. Deconvolution image restorations mode which defines level of image degradation. Originally deconvolution is a function which can restore image degraded convoluted by any natural function like blur during obtaining image by camera. Because we cannot detect image function which corrupt the image we have to check most well know functions like sharp or mathematical morphology

## QualitySettings.Deconvolution property

Deconvolution (image restorations) mode which defines level of image degradation. Originally deconvolution is a function which can restore image degraded (convoluted) by any natural function like blur, during obtaining image by camera. Because we cannot detect image function which corrupt the image, we have to check most well know functions like sharp or mathematical morphology.

```csharp
public DeconvolutionMode Deconvolution { get; set; }
```
