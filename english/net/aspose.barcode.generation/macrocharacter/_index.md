## MacroCharacter enumeration

Macro Characters 05 and 06 values are used to obtain more compact encoding in special modes. 05 Macro craracter is translated to "[)&gt;\u001E05\u001D" as decoded data header and "\u001E\u0004" as decoded data trailer. 06 Macro craracter is translated to "[)&gt;\u001E06\u001D" as decoded data header and "\u001E\u0004" as decoded data trailer.

```csharp
public enum MacroCharacter
