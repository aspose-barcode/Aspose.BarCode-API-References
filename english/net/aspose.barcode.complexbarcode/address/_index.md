## Address class

Address of creditor or debtor.

You can either set street, house number, postal code and town (type structured address) or address line 1 and 2 (type combined address elements). The type is automatically set once any of these fields is set. Before setting the fields, the address type is undetermined. If fields of both types are set, the address type becomes conflicting. Name and country code must always be set unless all fields are empty.

```csharp
public sealed class Address : IEquatable<Address>
```
