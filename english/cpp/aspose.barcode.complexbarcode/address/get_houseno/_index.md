## Address::get_HouseNo method


Gets the house number.

```cpp
System::String Aspose::BarCode::ComplexBarcode::Address::get_HouseNo()
```

## Remarks


Setting this field sets the address type to [AddressType::Structured](../../addresstype/) unless it's already [AddressType::CombinedElements](../../addresstype/), in which case it becomes [AddressType::Conflicting](../../addresstype/). 

This field is only used for structured addresses and is optional.
