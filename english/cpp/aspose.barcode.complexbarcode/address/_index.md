## Remarks


You can either set street, house number, postal code and town (type *structured address*) or address line 1 and 2 (type *combined address elements*). The type is automatically set once any of these fields is set. Before setting the fields, the address type is *undetermined*. If fields of both types are set, the address type becomes *conflicting*. Name and country code must always be set unless all fields are empty.
