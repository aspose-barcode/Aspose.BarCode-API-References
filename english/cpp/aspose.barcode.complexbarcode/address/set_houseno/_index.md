## Address::set_HouseNo method


Sets the house number.

```cpp
void Aspose::BarCode::ComplexBarcode::Address::set_HouseNo(System::String value)
```

## Remarks


Setting this field sets the address type to [AddressType::Structured](../../addresstype/) unless it's already [AddressType::CombinedElements](../../addresstype/), in which case it becomes [AddressType::Conflicting](../../addresstype/). 

This field is only used for structured addresses and is optional. 

The house number.
