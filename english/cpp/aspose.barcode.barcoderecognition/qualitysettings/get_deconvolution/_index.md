## QualitySettings::get_Deconvolution method


Deconvolution (image restorations) mode which defines level of image degradation. Originally deconvolution is a function which can restore image degraded (convoluted) by any natural function like blur, during obtaining image by camera. Because we cannot detect image function which corrupt the image, we have to check most well know functions like sharp or mathematical morphology.

```cpp
DeconvolutionMode Aspose::BarCode::BarCodeRecognition::QualitySettings::get_Deconvolution() const
```

## Remarks


Deconvolution mode which defines level of image degradation.
